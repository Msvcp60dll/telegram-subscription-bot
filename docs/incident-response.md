python scripts/monitor_production.py --check database

# Check Supabase status
curl https://status.supabase.com/api/v2/status.json

# Test direct connection
python scripts/test_supabase_connection.py
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

grep "payment" logs/telegram_subscription_bot_payments.log | tail -50

# Test webhook endpoint
curl https://your-railway-url/health
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify payment provider API status
2. Check webhook configuration
3. Verify API keys are valid
4. Review recent payment logs
5. Check for webhook timeouts

python scripts/monitor_production.py --continuous --interval 10
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Identify memory leaks
2. Check for infinite loops
3. Review recent code changes
4. Analyze database query performance
5. Check for excessive logging

**Resolution:**

curl -X POST https://your-railway-url/webhook/airwallex \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Check webhook logs
railway logs | grep webhook
```

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Verify webhook URL configuration
2. Check SSL certificate validity
3. Verify webhook secret
4. Test network connectivity
5. Review webhook handler code

**Resolution:**
- Update webhook URL in payment provider
- Fix SSL certificate issues
- Update webhook secret
- Implement webhook retry logic
- Add webhook validation logging

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (Railway)

```bash
# List recent deployments
railway deployments list

# Rollback to previous deployment
railway deployments rollback [deployment-id]

# Verify rollback
railway status
```

### Database Rollback

```bash
# Create backup before any changes
python scripts/backup_database.py

# Restore from backup
python scripts/restore_database.py --backup-file [filename]
```

### Configuration Rollback

```bash
# Revert environment variables
railway variables set BOT_TOKEN=[old-token]
railway variables set SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=[old-key]

# Restart service
railway restart
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Complete Service Restart

```bash
# 1. Stop the service
railway down

# 2. Clear any locks/temp files
rm -f *.lock temp/*

# 3. Restart service

# 4. Verify service is running
python scripts/monitor_production.py --full-check
```

### Emergency Maintenance Mode

MAINTENANCE_MODE = True
MAINTENANCE_MESSAGE = "Bot is under maintenance. Please try again in 30 minutes."

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Data Recovery

```bash
# Export critical data
python scripts/export_critical_data.py

# Verify data integrity

# Import to new instance if needed
python scripts/import_data.py --file backup.json
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Set Up Continuous Monitoring

# Start monitoring daemon
nohup python scripts/monitor_production.py --continuous --interval 60 &

# Set up alert webhook
export ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
export ALERT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="-1001234567890"
```
