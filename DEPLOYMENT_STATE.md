## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### If Build Fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Common Issues & Solutions:**

   | Error | Solution |
   |-------|----------|
   | Module not found | Add to requirements.txt |
   | Port binding error | Check PORT env var (should be 8080) |
   | Memory exceeded | Optimize imports, reduce dependencies |
   | Build timeout | Simplify build process, check nixpacks.toml |

3. **Quick Fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Re-deploy after fixes
   cd ~/TGbot
   railway up --detach
   ```

### If Bot Doesn't Respond:

1. **Verify Bot Token**
   ```bash
   railway variables | grep BOT_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Check Database Connection**
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep -i supabase
   ```

3. **Verify Webhook URL**
   ```bash
   railway variables | grep WEBHOOK_BASE_URL
   ```
